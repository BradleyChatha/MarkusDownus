# Overview

A highly extensible Markdown parser that pretends to be CommonMark compliant:

`Passed 171 (26.227%) | Failed 462 (70.8589%) | Ignored 19 (2.91411%)`

*oh dear*

Anyway, super alpha, no docs for now, use at your own risk or just study the code since that's the interesting part.

And yes, *another* alpha library from your's truly.
